Nexter Technical Test
================
Introduction
----------------
I've used  .Net Core 3 and Mediatr to implement the Mediator Pattern.Mediatr  (similar to CQRS) and encourages the KISS prinicple which I've had great successes with over the past year. 
* It allows loose/decoupled objects
* Enables Inversion of Control as the dependencies are minimised.
* Processes Application Requests easier for APIs more efficiently
* Allows you to organise the application into feature slices making it easier to work with in an agile framework
* Easy to integrate automated testing

I've also configured swagger so any developer who wishes to test the api can do so, and have self documented online API methods listed.  

I've used Moq and Nunit for automated testing.
